        | The Umbro Soccer kit fabric is engineered to maximise climate control and comfort. 
        | It does this by the use of a polyester fabric that has a cotton feel. This wicks
        | sweat away from the body keeping the wearer cool and dry. The garment design
        | features openings that run across the side of the shirt for ventilation.

        | In a move meant to connect with Canada's fans and inspire its players, the new
        | Umbro kit features a sound wave graphic of the national anthem “O Canada”, which
        | is sewn into the shirts and shorts.

        | The sound wave graphic is created by taking
        | the waveform that is generated by recording the sound in a digital medium, then
        | playing it back in a visual form.
