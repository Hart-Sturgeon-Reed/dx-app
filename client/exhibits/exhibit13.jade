        | Adidas was known for the typical three stripes branding early in its history and
        | when designs for shoes were registered in 1949, they incorporated the logo along
        | the side. A Finnish sports brand named Karhu Sports sold the three stripe trademark to
        | adidas for the equivalent of CA $2,200 and two bottles of Whiskey.

        | The adiZero utilises adidas Primeknit technology. This uses a knitted 3D
        | structure that creates a highly engineered textile upper in one piece. 
        | The result is an extremely lightweight trainer that combines performance with
        | comfort, an ultra-breathable construction, durability, and water resistance.

        | The adizero shoes are recognizable for their knit which carries a distinctive
        | pattern. Knitting is a technique for producing a two or three-dimensional fabric
        | made from a yarn or thread.

        | In sports footwear the yarn is usually polyester or nylon because of their
        | strength and versatility. As a textile structure, knit in general provides
        | greater elasticity than a woven fabric. The choice of yarn and knit further
        | impact the strength, elasticity and support that the uppers provide.
