        | The Virus StayWarm Performance series is engineered to keep the athleteâ€™s body
        | warm, dry, and comfortable. The Coffee Charcoal fabric is combined with a wicking
        | technology that moves moisture away from the body to keep the wearer warm and dry -
        | acting as a natural heating element and increasing skin surface temperatures.
